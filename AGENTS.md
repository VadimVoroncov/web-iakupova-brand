## Project Summary
A high-end luxury website for "IAKUPOVA", a bespoke tailoring brand based in Rome. The site features a minimalist aesthetic inspired by Dior and YSL, with a focus on elegant typography, high contrast, and smooth animations. It supports multiple languages (Russian, English, Italian) and includes a splash screen with a logo fade-out effect.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: React (Vite)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animations: Framer Motion
- Icons: Lucide React
- Fonts: Playfair Display (Serif), Inter (Sans-serif)

## Architecture
- `src/App.tsx`: Main application entry and routing logic.
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components (Navbar, SplashScreen, LanguageSelector).
- `src/context`: State management for language and splash screen.
- `src/lib`: Utility functions and static content (translations).
- `src/index.css`: Global styles and Tailwind imports.

## User Preferences
- Minimalist, "luxury" aesthetic (Dior, YSL, Bouguessa references).

- Immediate language selection flow.

## Project Guidelines
- Maintain high contrast and whitespace for a luxury feel.
- Use serif fonts for headings and sans-serif for body text.
- Ensure all content is translated across RU, EN, and IT.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Use Vite for fast development and building.
